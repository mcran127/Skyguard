This code comes from Brigham Young University Center of Animation's 2025 video game capstone project. The code provided is for Unreal Engine 5.

Within this project, I was a gameplay programmer but I had the opportunity to help with UI, game balance, and a small bit of animation. The tools, objects, and skills I used in this project include:
- Animation notifies and notfiy states
- Line traces, collision profiles, and trace channels
- Meshes and capsule components
- Player movement components
- Interactions between the player, the player state, the game mode, and game state
- Player viewport versus the player screen on a local multiplayer game
- Working with putting effects and animations into the game including gameplay cues
- The Gameplay Ability System (GAS)

Within my primary role, I primarily worked on the modular weapon system including different ammo types from grenades, to piercing, to chain lighting ammo, and different gun types like a shotgun and gatling gun. This not only included base functionality of being able to deal damage in a variety of ways, but implementing a proper aiming system, helping the player face the camera, backedaling (removed in the final version), and more. In addtion, I was the main worker ont the jump pads and man cannons, objects meant to launch the player around the map.

Lastly, I helped on a number of features which may not be included here such as enemies, the main player, movement, game balancing

While not all the code provided is specifically mine, I was the main, significant contributor to the provided files.
